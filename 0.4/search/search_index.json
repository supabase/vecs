This guide will help you get started with using vecs. If you don't have a Postgres database with the pgvector ready, see hosting for easy options. Installation Requires: Python 3.7+ You can install vecs using pip: pip install vecs Usage Connecting Before you can interact with vecs, create the client to communicate with Postgres. If you haven't started a Postgres instance yet, see hosting . import vecs DB_CONNECTION = \"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>\" # create vector store client vx = vecs . create_client ( DB_CONNECTION ) Get or Create a Collection You can get a collection (or create if it doesn't exist), specifying the collection's name and the number of dimensions for the vectors you intend to store. docs = vx . get_or_create_collection ( name = \"docs\" , dimension = 3 ) Upserting vectors vecs combines the concepts of \"insert\" and \"update\" into \"upsert\". Upserting records adds them to the collection if the id is not present, or updates the existing record if the id does exist. # add records to the collection docs . upsert ( records = [ ( \"vec0\" , # the vector's identifier [ 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 ], # the vector. list or np.array { \"year\" : 1973 } # associated metadata ), ( \"vec1\" , [ 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 ], { \"year\" : 2012 } ) ] ) Deleting vectors Deleting records removes them from the collection. To delete records, specify a list of ids or metadata filters to the delete method. The ids of the sucessfully deleted records are returned from the method. Note that attempting to delete non-existent records does not raise an error. docs . delete ( ids = [ \"vec0\" , \"vec1\" ]) # or delete by a metadata filter docs . delete ( filters = { \"year\" : { \"$eq\" : 2012 }}) Create an index Collections can be queried immediately after being created. However, for good throughput, the collection should be indexed after records have been upserted. Only one index may exist per-collection. By default, creating an index will replace any existing index. To create an index: docs . create_index () You may optionally provide a distance measure and index method. Available options for distance measure are: vecs.IndexMeasure.cosine_distance vecs.IndexMeasure.l2_distance vecs.IndexMeasure.max_inner_product which correspond to different methods for comparing query vectors to the vectors in the database. If you aren't sure which to use, the default of cosine_distance is the most widely compatible with off-the-shelf embedding methods. Available options for index method are: vecs.IndexMethod.auto vecs.IndexMethod.hnsw vecs.IndexMethod.ivfflat Where auto selects the best available index method, hnsw uses the HNSW method and ivfflat uses IVFFlat . HNSW and IVFFlat indexes both allow for parameterization to control the speed/accuracy tradeoff. vecs provides sane defaults for these parameters. For a greater level of control you can optionally pass an instance of vecs.IndexArgsIVFFlat or vecs.IndexArgsHNSW to create_index 's index_arguments argument. Descriptions of the impact for each parameter are available in the pgvector docs . When using IVFFlat indexes, the index must be created after the collection has been populated with records. Building an IVFFlat index on an empty collection will result in significantly reduced recall. You can continue upserting new documents after the index has been created, but should rebuild the index if the size of the collection more than doubles since the last index operation. HNSW indexes can be created immediately after the collection without populating records. To manually specify method , measure , and index_arguments add them as arguments to create_index for example: docs . create_index ( method = IndexMethod . hnsw , measure = IndexMeasure . cosine_distance , measure = IndexArgsHNSW ( m = 8 ), ) Note The time required to create an index grows with the number of records and size of vectors. For a few thousand records expect sub-minute a response in under a minute. It may take a few minutes for larger collections. Query Given a collection docs with several records: Basic The simplest form of search is to provide a query vector. Note Indexes are essential for good performance. See creating an index for more info. If you do not create an index, every query will return a warning query does not have a covering index for cosine_similarity.

Metadata Filtering The metadata that is associated with each record can also be filtered during a query. As an example, {\"year\": {\"$eq\": 2005}} filters a year metadata key to be equal to 2005 In context: docs . query ( data = [ 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 ], filters = { \"year\" : { \"$eq\" : 2012 }}, # metadata filters ) For a complete reference, see the metadata guide .

Built-in Adapters vecs provides several built-in Adapters. ParagraphChunker TextEmbedding Have an idea for a useful adapter? Open an issue requesting it. ParagraphChunker The ParagraphChunker AdapterStep splits text media into paragraphs and yields each paragraph as a separate record. That can be a useful preprocessing step when upserting large documents that contain multiple paragraphs. The ParagraphChunker delimits paragraphs by two consecutive line breaks \\n\\n . ParagrphChunker is a pre-preocessing step and must be used in combination with another adapter step like TextEmbedding to transform the chunked text into a vector. from vecs.adapter import Adapter , ParagraphChunker ... vx . get_or_create_collection ( name = \"docs\" , adapter = Adapter ( [ ParagraphChunker ( skip_during_query = True ), ... ] ) ) When querying the collection, you probably do not want to chunk the text. To skip text chunking during queries, set the skip_during_query argument to True . Setting skip_during_query to False will raise an exception if the input text contains more than one paragraph. TextEmbedding The TextEmbedding AdapterStep accepts text and converts it into a vector that can be consumed by the Collection . TextEmbedding supports all models available in the sentence_transformers package. A complete list of supported models is available in vecs.adapter.TextEmbeddingModel . from vecs.adapter import Adapter , TextEmbedding ... vx . get_or_create_collection ( name = \"docs\" , adapter = Adapter ( [ TextEmbedding ( model = 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' ) ] ) ) # search by text docs . query ( data = \"foo bar\" ) Interface Adapters are objects that take in data in the form of Iterable[Tuple[str, Any, Optional[Dict]]] where Tuple[str, Any, Optional[Dict]]] represents records of (id, media, metadata) .

See Collection.create_index As each query vector must be checked against every record in the collection. When the number of dimensions and/or number of records becomes large, that becomes extremely slow and computationally expensive. An index is a heuristic datastructure that pre-computes distances among key points in the vector space. It is smaller and can be traversed more quickly than the whole collection enabling much more performant seraching. Only one index may exist per-collection. An index optimizes a collection for searching according to a selected distance measure. To create an index: docs . create_index () You may optionally provide a distance measure and index method. Available options for distance measure are: vecs.IndexMeasure.cosine_distance vecs.IndexMeasure.l2_distance vecs.IndexMeasure.max_inner_product which correspond to different methods for comparing query vectors to the vectors in the database. If you aren't sure which to use, the default of cosine_distance is the most widely compatible with off-the-shelf embedding methods. Available options for index method are: vecs.IndexMethod.auto vecs.IndexMethod.hnsw vecs.IndexMethod.ivfflat Where auto selects the best available index method, hnsw uses the HNSW method and ivfflat uses IVFFlat . HNSW and IVFFlat indexes both allow for parameterization to control the speed/accuracy tradeoff. vecs provides sane defaults for these parameters. For a greater level of control you can optionally pass an instance of vecs.IndexArgsIVFFlat or vecs.IndexArgsHNSW to create_index 's index_arguments argument. Descriptions of the impact for each parameter are available in the pgvector docs . When using IVFFlat indexes, the index must be created after the collection has been populated with records. Building an IVFFlat index on an empty collection will result in significantly reduced recall. You can continue upserting new documents after the index has been created, but should rebuild the index if the size of the collection more than doubles since the last index operation. HNSW indexes can be created immediately after the collection without populating records. To manually specify method , measure , and index_arguments add them as arguments to create_index for example: docs . create_index ( method = IndexMethod . hnsw , measure = IndexMeasure . cosine_distance , measure = IndexArgsHNSW ( m = 8 ), ) Note The time required to create an index grows with the number of records and size of vectors. For a few thousand records expect sub-minute a response in under a minute. It may take a few minutes for larger collections.","title":"Indexes"},{"location":"concepts_metadata/","text":"Metadata vecs allows you to associate key-value pairs of metadata with indexes and ids in your collections. You can then add filters to queries that reference the metadata metadata. Types Metadata is stored as binary JSON. As a result, allowed metadata types are drawn from JSON primitive types. Boolean String Number The technical limit of a metadata field associated with a vector is 1GB. In practice you should keep metadata fields as small as possible to maximize performance. Metadata Query Language The metadata query language is based loosely on mongodb's selectors . vecs currently supports a subset of those operators. Comparison Operators Comparison operators compare a provided value with a value stored in metadata field of the vector store. Operator Description $eq Matches values that are equal to a specified value $ne Matches values that are not equal to a specified value $gt Matches values that are greater than a specified value $gte Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value $lt Matches values that are less than a specified value $lte Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value $in Matches values that are contained by scalar list of specified values Logical Operators Logical operators compose other operators, and can be nested. Operator Description $and Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses. $or Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause. Performance For best performance, use scalar key-value pairs for metadata and prefer $eq , $and and $or filters where possible. Those variants are most consistently able to make use of indexes.

Embedding . create ( model = \"text-embedding-ada-002\" , input = [ sentence ] ) embeddings . append (( sentence , response [ \"data\" ][ 0 ][ \"embedding\" ], {})) Store the Embeddings with vecs Now that we have our embeddings, we can insert them into a PostgreSQL database using vecs. import vecs DB_CONNECTION = \"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>\" # create vector store client vx = vecs . Client ( DB_CONNECTION ) # create a collection named 'sentences' with 1536 dimensional vectors (default dimension for text-embedding-ada-002) sentences = vx . get_or_create_collection ( name = \"sentences\" , dimension = 1536 ) # upsert the embeddings into the 'sentences' collection sentences . upsert ( records = embeddings ) # create an index for the 'sentences' collection sentences . create_index () Querying for Most Similar Sentences Finally, we can query vecs to find the most similar sentences to a given query sentence. We will first need to create an embedding for the query sentence using the text-embedding-ada-002 model. query_sentence = \"A quick animal jumps over a lazy one.\" # create an embedding for the query sentence response = openai . Embedding . create ( model = \"text-embedding-ada-002\" , input = [ query_sentence ] ) query_embedding = response [ \"data\" ][ 0 ][ \"embedding\" ] # query the 'sentences' collection for the most similar sentences results = sentences . query ( data = query_embedding , limit = 3 , include_value = True ) # print the results for result in results : print ( result ) Returns the most similar 3 records and their distance to the query vector.
